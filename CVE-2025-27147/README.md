GLPI Inventory Plugin	< 1.5.0 - Improper Access Control Vulnerability


## Summary
An Improper Access Control Vulnerability Leading to Authenticated Arbitrary File Download in the GLPIInventory plugin allows attackers to read arbitrary files on the server without restrictions. Exploiting this flaw enables access to sensitive system files, potentially exposing credentials, configurations, and other critical data.

##  Details
In the general settings section of the plugin, under package management, the "Root folder for sending server files" option allows directing the server to other directories. This enables downloading system files through the package management menu. By navigating to Package Management > Package Actions > Files, it is possible to select files from the specified directory and download them.
